== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder 'car-rental' to the directory '/wp-content/plugins/'
2. Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can adjust the necessary settings using your WordPress admin panel in "Cars" > "Settings".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add a Car? =

Please follow the next steps:
1. Click on "Cars" on the admin panel, then click on the "Add New";
2. Fill in all fields;
3. Click "Publish" button.

= How can I add a slide? =

Please complete the following steps:
1. Go to the "Cars" > "Slider" page in the admin panel.
2. Click "Add New Slide".
3. Fill in the necessary fields.
4. Click "Add Slide" button.

= How can I display the Slider on my homepage? =

If you want to use the plugin with another theme and enable the slider on your homepage, find the "header.php" file of your theme, and add the following code after `<header>` block or to any necessary place:
`<?php do_action( 'crrntl_display_slider' ); ?>`

= How can I add the Slider to a custom template? =

In order to display the Slider on any page (e.g. that uses some custom template), add the following code to the necessary place of the corresponding template file:
`<?php do_action( 'crrntl_display_slider_custom' ); ?>`

= How to change or override plugin templates? =

Plugin template files can be found in the '/wp-content/plugins/car-rental-pro/templates/' directory.
You can edit these files in an upgrade-safe way using overrides. Copy them into a directory with your theme named '/bws-templates'.

Example: To override the 'BWS Choose Car' page template, please copy '/wp-content/plugins/car-rental-pro/templates/page-choose-car.php' to 'wp-content/themes/your-theme/bws-templates/page-choose-car.php'.

Do not edit these files in the plugin's core directly as they are overwritten during the upgrade process and any customizations will be lost.
